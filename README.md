# GPS tracker based on SIM800C GSM module, L80R GPS and MMA8452QR1 Accelerometer

This is the main repository containing documentation and code for the GPS tracker device I have built during the 2019-2020. I am not a professional electronic designer, however I was studing electronics during my college years. Professionally I am a Software Engineer with experience in cloud computing, XP practicess and modern programming languages (Node.js and Go).

## Project goals and intentions

Myself and my partner are a proud "parents" of a lovely dog called Russel. Russel loves to chase various animals that are present in the forests nearby our house. One day on a walk, to our rising panic levels Russel dissappeared from our view chasing a deer. We have discussed purchasing a GPS collar for him, but that would be too easy. So I set of on a never ending project to build a GPS tracker, small enough to fit on his collar. 

After a solid year of engineering this is what it looked like :

## GPS tracker requirements

- [] Small enough to fit on a dog collar
- [] Enough battery life to run for 2 days
- [] Three update modes
    - Continouos (update as fast as possible, when moving and app was used within last 5 minutes)
    - Every minute (standard when moving)
    - Every hour (when not moving)
